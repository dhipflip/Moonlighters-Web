    <h1>We Are Moonlighters.</h1>
    <p>A group of Hard Working Professionals who enjoy our full-time Softare Engineering day jobs so much... that we actually wanted to spend our <em>spare time</em> searching for and working on Web Application passion projects.</p>
    <p>Info about our Tech Stack</p>
    <h2>Design. Build. Launch</h2>
    <p>We&apos;ll strive to make the process as pain-free and transparent as possible, starting with an introductory discussion so we can learn about your project and determine if we&apos;re right for the job.</p>
    <p> Once partnered we&apos;ll work with you to outline the process, review any resources you want to share and then the fun really begins... designing, building and hosting your app!</p>
